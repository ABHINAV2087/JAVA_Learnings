# Java and Computer basics

### Intro to 32 bit and 64 bit Operating System

> In computing, a byte is the unit of data, and processing is generally denoted as bit processing.

> Generally, there exist two types of processors, namely a 32-bit processor and a 64-bit processor.

- >A 32-bit system can access 2<sup>32</sup> memory addresses, i.e., 4 GB of RAM or physical memory; ideally, it can also access more than 4 GB of RAM.

- > A 64-bit system can access 2<sup>64</sup> memory addresses, i.e., actually 18-Quintillion bytes of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it.


## Features of Java

![Alt text](/images/image.png)

* <u>Object Oriented</u>: In object oriented programming everything is an object rather that function and logic.

* <u>Simple</u>: Java is simple to understand, easy to learn and implement.

* <u>Secured</u>: It is possible to design secured software systems using Java.

* <u>Platform Independent</u>: Java is write once and run anywhere language, meaning once the code is written, it can be executed on any software and hardware systems.

* <u>Portable</u>: Java is not necessarily fixated to a single hardware machine. Once created, java code can be used on any platform.

* <u>Architecture Neutral</u>: Java is architecture neutral meaning the size of primitive type is fixed and does not vary depending upon the type of architecture.

* <u>Robust</u>: Java emphasizes a lot on error handling, type checking, memory management, etc. This makes it a robust language.

* <u>Interpreted</u>: Java converts high-level program statement into Assembly Level Language, thus making it interpreted.

* <u>Distributed</u>: Java lets us create distributed applications that can run on multiple computers simultaneously.

* <u>Dynamic</u>: Java is designed to adapt to ever evolving systems thus making it dynamic.

* <u>Multi-thread</u>: multi-threading is an important feature provided by java for creating web applications.

* <u>High-performance</u>: Java uses Just-In-Time compiler thus giving us a high performance.

- >  Unlike most programming languages that generates executable code upon compilation; the 
JVM generates byte codes as a result of compilation.<br>
Java byte codes are form of instructions 
understood by Java Virtual Machine and usually generated as a result of compiling Java 
languages source code

- >Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by the Java run-time system, which is called the JVM

# JVM  vs JRE vs JDK
 - In hierarchial order <br>
   * JVM -> JRE -> JDK
   
- > JVM ( Java Virtual Machine )<br>
   1. The JVM is a virtual computer that executes Java bytecode
   2. ï»¿It is the code execution component of java
   * Important components of java are <br>
    -> Interpreter <br>
    -> Garbage Collector
- > JRE ( Java Run Environment )<br>
   1. The JRE is a package that includes the JVM and necessary libraries to run Java applications. 
   
- > JDK ( Java Development Kit )<br>
   1. Contains the JRE and development tools for writing, compiling, and debugging Java applications.
