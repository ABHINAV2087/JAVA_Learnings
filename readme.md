# Java and Computer basics

### Intro to 32 bit and 64 bit Operating System

> In computing, a byte is the unit of data, and processing is generally denoted as bit processing.

> Generally, there exist two types of processors, namely a 32-bit processor and a 64-bit processor.

- >A 32-bit system can access 2<sup>32</sup> memory addresses, i.e., 4 GB of RAM or physical memory; ideally, it can also access more than 4 GB of RAM.

- > A 64-bit system can access 2<sup>64</sup> memory addresses, i.e., actually 18-Quintillion bytes of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it.


## Features of Java

![Alt text](./images/image.png)

* <u>Object Oriented</u>: In object oriented programming everything is an object rather that function and logic.

* <u>Simple</u>: Java is simple to understand, easy to learn and implement.

* <u>Secured</u>: It is possible to design secured software systems using Java.

* <u>Platform Independent</u>: Java is write once and run anywhere language, meaning once the code is written, it can be executed on any software and hardware systems.

* <u>Portable</u>: Java is not necessarily fixated to a single hardware machine. Once created, java code can be used on any platform.

* <u>Architecture Neutral</u>: Java is architecture neutral meaning the size of primitive type is fixed and does not vary depending upon the type of architecture.

* <u>Robust</u>: Java emphasizes a lot on error handling, type checking, memory management, etc. This makes it a robust language.

* <u>Interpreted</u>: Java converts high-level program statement into Assembly Level Language, thus making it interpreted.

* <u>Distributed</u>: Java lets us create distributed applications that can run on multiple computers simultaneously.

* <u>Dynamic</u>: Java is designed to adapt to ever evolving systems thus making it dynamic.

* <u>Multi-thread</u>: multi-threading is an important feature provided by java for creating web applications.

* <u>High-performance</u>: Java uses Just-In-Time compiler thus giving us a high performance.

   ## First Java Program

```java
public class Abc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

```


1. **`public`**:
   - `public` is an access modifier in Java. It indicates that the class or method can be accessed from any other class or package. In this case, `public` is used to declare the class `HelloWorld`, which means it can be accessed from any other class.

2. **`class`**:
   - `class` is a keyword in Java used to define a class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects.<br> It encapsulates data (fields) and behavior (methods) related to a particular concept or entity.

3. **`Abc`**:
   - This is the name of the class.<br> In Java, class names are case-sensitive and should match the name of the file in which the class is defined (including capitalization).<br> In this case, the class is named `Abc`, so it should be saved in a file named `Abc.java`.

4. **`{}`**:
   - Curly braces are used to define blocks of code. In this program, they are used to define the body of the `HelloWorld` class and the `main` method.

5. 
      - `public`: Access modifier indicating that the method is accessible from any class.
      - `static`: In Java, you can use the static keyword to declare that a certain variable or method is shared by all instances of the class
      - `void`: Specifies that the method does not return any value.
      - `main`: The name of the method.
      - `(String[] args)`: The method takes an array of strings as input. This parameter allows you to pass arguments to the program when it is executed from the command line.

7. **`main(String[] args)`** (continued):
   - The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It's where the program starts executing. It is called when the program is run, and it takes an array of strings (`args`) as input. These are the arguments that can be passed to the program when it is executed from the command line.

8. **`args`**:
   - `args` is a parameter of the `main` method. It is an array of strings that allows you to pass arguments to the program when it is executed. For example, if you run the program from the command line like this: `java HelloWorld arg1 arg2`, `args` will be an array containing `["arg1", "arg2"]`.


- > In Java we usually call <i>`functions`</i> as  <i>`methods`</i> 

- > * <u>Method</u> -> Associated with an object or class in object-oriented programming.<br>
<u>Function</u> -> Standalone block of code.

### Implicit type conversion

Implicit type conversion in Java happens when the Java compiler automatically converts one data type to another without any explicit instructions from the programmer.
```java

int numInt = 10; // This is an integer variable
double numDouble; // This is a double variable

numDouble = numInt; // Implicit type conversion: int to double

System.out.println("Integer value: " + numInt);
System.out.println("Double value after implicit conversion: " + numDouble);


```
### Explicit type conversion

Explicit type conversion, also known as type casting, in Java involves converting a variable of one data type to another by the programmer's explicit instruction
```java

double numDouble = 10.5; // This is a double variable
int numInt; // This is an integer variable

numInt = (int) numDouble; // Explicit type conversion: double to int

System.out.println("Double value: " + numDouble);
System.out.println("Integer value after explicit conversion: " + numInt);

```

- > How many types of variables are there ?<br>
   In Java there are 3 types of variables:
   1. <u>Local variables</u> : Declared inside method body

   2. <u>Instance variables</u> : Declared inside class body
   3. <u>static variables</u> : Declared inside class body prefixed with the keyword static

## Using String Class Methods 

In Java string is a very userful predefined class and it contains a huge set of predefined methods which allow us to perform various operations on strings.

But the maximum of these methods in java are non-static . This means for calling them we must learn how to create objects of string class

```java
// creating object 

class Student 
{
   int roll;
   char grade;
   double per;
   // some methods 
   get();
   show();
}

Student S = new Student();
S.get();
S.show();

```
### Using String Class 

```java
class Test 
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      String s1 = new String("abhinav");
      String s2 = new String("tirole");
      System.out.println(s1); // abhinav
      System.out.println(s2); // tirole
      
      
      System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
      // this will give false  
   }
}
```
- > whenever we display string object references <br>Java will never show the adresses stored in these references <br>Rather Java will always print the contents of the STRING OBJECTS to which the reference is pointing  
- > however when we compare two references then , Java doesn't compare the contents of the object pointed by these references rather java compares the adresses stored in these references

       The ternary operator can be used as an alternative to the Java's 
       if-else and switch statements.

       var_name = (test condition) ?(true_exprssiom):(false_expression)

### Scanner class

* Important methods of Scanner Class <br>

    ```java
         public int nextInt() => accepts an integer as input 

         public double nextDouble() => accepts an double value as input 

         public float nextFloat() => accepts an float value as input 

         public boolean nextBoolean() => accepts an boolean value as input    
       .
       .
       .
       .
      Like this we have nextXXX() methods for every primitive data type except character



      for accepting Strings we have 2 methods in Scanner class:
      1. public String next()
      2. public Stting nextLine()

###   Arguments passing in java

In java , arguments are passed by value . 
not passed by reference

In java , we can pass 2 kinds of arguments to methods :<br>
#### 1. <u> Passing variables</u>
 * 1. whenever we pass a variable as a argument to a method , java always passes it value
 * 2. this value is then received by another variable declared in the formal arg list of the method being called
 * 3. so, now , both the arguments , actual and formal , have the same value 
 * 4. but their adressess are different 
 * 5. so if we make any change in the value of formal argument , then it will never change the value of actual argument 
 * 6. so . the conclusion is that , variables in java are always passed using pass by value mechanism  


#### 2. <u> Passing reference as argument to method </u>( array reference , object reference )


 * 1. whenever we pass any reference as argument to a method , then java passes the adress of the object pointed by that reference
 * 2. this address is then received by the formal reference declared inside the method's argument list
 * 3. so now both the actual reference and the formal reference start pointing to the same object 
 * 4. thus if we make any changes in the formal reference itself then it will never effect the actual reference nor it will effect the original objects data
 * 5. but if we make some changes in the formal reference itself then it will never effect the actual referennce nor it will effect the original object
 * 6. thus we say that even reference in java are passed using pass by value 
 * 7. so the final conclusion is that<U> NOTHING IN JAVA IS PASSED USING PASS BY REFERENCE</U >
